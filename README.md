# Progress Reports

As my final project for 67-328 (Mobile to Cloud: Building Distributed Applications), I made a social productivity application that uses “progress reports.” Two people who have any kind of work to do would use the system at the same time. They would then each set a goal to be reached in the same amount of time (for example, one user could say “I will write my introductory paragraph to this essay in the next 20 minutes” while the other could say “I will complete one problem in my pset in the next 20 minutes.”) A timer will be set, and the two users would confer over a simple chat box and update the other with their progress, and set another goal at the end of the time period. The addition of immediate accountability during work will help users to stay focused and complete their work quickly.

This application is deployed at [progressreports-aditisar.rhcloud.com](http://progressreports-aditisar.rhcloud.com/). 

It is subject to change in the future with support for more than one pair of users (rooms) and for db storage on user history.
